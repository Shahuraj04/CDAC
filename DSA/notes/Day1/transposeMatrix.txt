Transpose a Matrix
------------------
Statement : Given a square matrix (n x n), transpose it in-place. Transposing means converting rows to columns.
------------------
Input:  matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output: matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]

Input:  matrix = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]

Output: matrix = [
  [1, 3],
  [2, 4]
]

Hints:
Why j starts from i+1?
If we process entire matrix:
- Swap (0,1) with (1,0) ✓
- Later swap (1,0) with (0,1) again ✗ (back to original!)

By starting j from i+1:
- Only process upper triangle
- Each pair swapped exactly once

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Iterate through upper triangle: n(n-1)/2 elements
Each swap is O(1)
O(n²/2) = O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Only one temp variable for swapping
Transpose done in-place
