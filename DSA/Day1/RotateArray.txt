Rotate Array Right by k Positions
----------------------------------------
Statement : Given an array and a number k, rotate the array to the right by k steps. 

Note: k can be larger than array length.
-----------------------------------------

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Result: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] 

-----------------------------------------

Hint:

Step 1: Reverse entire array
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Step 2: Reverse first k=2 elements
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1] → [4, 5, 3, 2, 1]
 └─┘

Step 3: Reverse remaining n-k=3 elements
[4, 5, 3, 2, 1] → [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
       └─────┘



Why k % n?
If arr = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
Rotating by 5 is same as rotating by 5 % 3 = 2
Because after 3 rotations, array returns to original state

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)

Each reversal is O(n) in worst case
Three reversals: O(n) + O(k) + O(n-k) = O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Only constant extra variables
All operations in-place
