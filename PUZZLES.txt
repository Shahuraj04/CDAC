Puzzle 1:For those who didn't understand 
Price of ball = x
Price of bat = x+500
Total price = 510
Therefore, x+(x+500) = 510
2x+500 = 510
or, 2x = 510-500
or, 2x = 10
or, x = 10/2
or, x = 5

Therefore, 
Price of ball = ₹5
Price of bat = ₹510 - ₹5 = ₹505

We can also say, 
₹505 - ₹5 = ₹500
Therefore, bat's price is ₹500 more than 
ball's price
