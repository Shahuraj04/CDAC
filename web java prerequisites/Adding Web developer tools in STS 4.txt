STS 4 by default does not support Web Developer Tools.

In the supplied STS 4 . 7 zip ,for windows,  I have already configured it.
So thers is nothing additional required  for windows users.

But if you are using it on Mac , follow these steps

1.Go to Help → Install New Software

In the "Work with" box, paste this URL:

https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2023-12/
Press Enter (wait a few seconds for it to load).

2. Expand this section:

Web, XML, Java EE and OSGi Enterprise Development

Tick these 3 options inside it:

 Eclipse Web Developer Tools

 Eclipse Java Web Developer Tools

 Eclipse Java EE Developer Tools 

Click Next → Next → Accept License → Finish.

3. Restart STS when prompted.


4.  After restart, you will be able to:

Create Dynamic Web Projects

Create Servlets and JSPs

Add Tomcat Runtime easily

Deploy WAR files directly
