What is MVC ?
Model-View-Controller 

It is a standard industry grade design pattern , meant for clear cut (pre defined) separation of concerns(=tasks=responsibilities)

In Custom implementation(done by programmer) of the MVC pattern : 

Model -- Business logic layer (service layer) - java bean & POJOs - data 
View layer --JSP , Thymeleaf/Velocity/Angular/React/Vue/Next JS
Represents UI / presentation logic  (processing requests & generating response)

Controller -- Typically a servlet(used in Spring MVC ) or a filter(used in Struts 2 framework)
Manages 
 - navigation(routing) 
 - java beans(service layer)

Front Controller - 
It's an additional design pattern , along with MVC .

Job -
To ensure that ANY request coming from ANY client , 
is intercepted by a common (centralized) component
 - Front Contoller 

Works as = common gate keeper(or a centralized dispatcher or entry point of  MVC)
It will dispatch client requests to further components , based upon nature of the request
MVC flow 

Understand with a diagram.
