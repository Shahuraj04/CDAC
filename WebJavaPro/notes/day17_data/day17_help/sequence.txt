1. Revise development of backend using RESTful web service

A REST web service 
-  a way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the web (HTTP) using a stateless, lightweight, and resource-oriented architecture.

- REST (Representational State Transfer) 
 - is an architectural style, not a protocol or standard.
 - It defines a set of constraints on how web services should be designed.

RESTful Web Service -

A REST web service exposes data and functionality as resources that can be accessed through URLs (URIs).

Clients (like browsers, mobile apps, or React frontends) interact with these resources using HTTP methods.

REST Key Principles | Constraints

1. Stateless	
- Each request is independent 
 - server doesn’t remember previous ones
2. Client–Server	
 - Separation of frontend (client) and backend (server)
3. Uniform Interface	
 - Consistent way to access all resources.
4. Cacheable 
 - Responses can be cached(by frontend  to improve performance)
5. Layered System
 - Requests may pass through intermediaries 
 - The client doesn’t know if requests are served by one monolithic backend or multiple microservices.
 - The backend may have load balancers, caches, or proxies — transperent to the client.


2. Revise Annotations
  - @ResponseBody
 - @RestController
 - @RequestBody
 - @RequestParam
 - @PathVariable
 - @CrossOrigin

2.1 Revise ResponseEntity

3. Complete Update end point , connect it with React , understand the problem & fix it.
- Spring boot project - restaurants_backend

4. Spring Data JPA Practice
4.1 User sign in
i/p - email , password

4.2 List all users born between date range and of specified role , sorted as per reg amount

4.3 User sign up
 
4.4 Get the user paying max reg amount
Optional<User> findFirstByOrderByRegAmountDesc();
First can be replaced by Top


4.5 Find the user with the highest age
Optional<User> findTopByOrderByAgeDesc();

4.6 Oldest emp in a department (Emp *---->1 Department)
Optional<Emp> findTopByDepartmentNameOrderByAgeDesc(String deptName)

4.7  Delete Product category by name(given name-unique)
    void deleteByName(String name);

4.8   void deleteByCategoryId(Long categoryId);
  OR
long deleteByCategoryId(Long categoryId);


4.9 Count no of products in specified category
    long countByCategoryName(String categoryName);
 
4.10 
List<User> findTop10ByLastnameOrderBySubscriptionAmountDesc(String lastName)


5. Project Tips

5.1 Instead of sending a message (String) , wrap it in ApiResponse DTO & send it to front end.

5.2 Spring recommendation for D.I
-	Use constructor based D.I instead of field level D.I
-	 Since in constructor based D.I , dependency is created first n then dependent.
-	Using this approach – you can create singleton spring bean as immutable (with final fields) 
-	Eg In UserController
-	 Add @AllArgsConstructor
-	 private final UserService userService;

5.3 Develop backend of Healthcare appointment system.
Use cases

1. Patient Login / Doctor Login(User Login)  common
- Controller
 - UserController
URL - http://host:port/users/signin
Method - POST  (for security , JWT generation, JSON payload)
Eg . Patient Logs in 
Payload - email , password  (Auth Request DTO)
Success Resp -Sc 200 |201  Auth Resp DTO (user id ,name, email , role , message)
Failure Resp - SC 401 ApiResp DTO(status : succes | failure , timestamp , message)

Full stack Flow - 
For signin 
- front end sends JSON(email & password) to backend
- In case of successful signin ,backend sends JSON(auth resp dto) to front end.
- front end stores these details under sessionStorage(preferred) | localStorage , checks role -> navigates patient -> patient dashboard 

->front end makes a call to backend with user id 
- to fetch list of upcoming appointments

2. List upcoming patient appointments
i/p : path variable - user id (or simpler patient id)
Response - list of upcoming appointment dtos
Eg .
{
    "appointmentId": 1,
    "appointmentTS": "2025-11-08T10:30:00",
    "firstName": "Rajiv",
    "lastName": "Mehta"
 }

3. Book Appointment
Request Payload -   
{
  "patientId": 3,
  "doctorId": 5,
  "appointmentDateTime": "2025-11-05T10:30:00",
 }

Resp SC 201
{
  "appointmentId": 101,
  "doctorName": "Dr. Priya Sharma",
  "appointmentDateTime": "2025-11-05T10:30:00",
  "status": "SCHEDULED",
  "message": "Appointment booked successfully"
}

Error Resp SC 400 | 404
Api Response - with error message.

4. Patient Registration
Request -DTO (reg request dto)
{
  "userDetails": {
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "phone": "string",
    "dob": "string",
    "regAmount": 0
  },
  "gender": "MALE",
  "bloodGroup": "A_POSITIVE",
  "familyHistory": "string"
}

Resp 
Success -SC 201 +  ApiResp with  success message & patient id
Failure - Dup email - SC 409 (conflict) ApiResp with error message
or SC 400 ApiResp with error message



Optional work - 
5. Cancel Appointment
6. Doctor prescribes diag tests to patient
7. Display all diag tests for a patient
