Day 2
1. MANDATORY work

1.1 Download & Extract Apache Tomcat Web server 
- "web java prerequisites\Web Server n Jakarta EE docs\apache-tomcat-10.1.26.7z"
- Save it under Study Materials | Software folder 
- Add tomcat server to web java STS 4 workspace.

How ? 

Steps
1. Change the perspective to Java EE
 Window -> Perspective -> Change Perspective -> Other -> Java EE
2. Choose Servers
 - It will show you - NO servers
3. Click on the link
 - Choose Apache vendor & select Apache Tomcat 10.1
4. Next -> Browse & Choose Tomcat Installation directory (Tomcat Home)
5. Confirm JRE - JDK 21
6. Finish
7. Choose Apache Tomcat & start it. 
8. Launch Server console & see if Tomcat is up & running.
9. Create a dynamic web project ,to deploy monolithic web app (server side will render the view :HTTP  response content type : text/html)
10. Configure web.xml , with welcome file list.
11. Add index.html : welcome page (home page) with welcome message

12. Start Server side application
Right click on web project -> Run as -> Servler side app -> choose server -> finish
You can check the server console.

IDE will automatically a chrome (default web browser) & send a request to the web application.

eg : 
Request URL - http://localhost:8080/day2_web
response  : index.html will be rendered.


2. No need to import day2.1 
 - It was created without layers.

3. Directly import day2.2
 - Edit MySql connecto JAR classpath
 - Edit DB password , in DBUtils
 - Revise CRUD functionality with layers.

4. Mandatory assignment

4.1 Patient sign in
i/p - email , password
o/p - Patient details (via Patient POJO ) or error message.

4.2 Display patient details born between start date & end date
i/p - start date , end date
o/p - List of patient details

4.3 Delete Patient Details
i/p - patient id 
o/p - a message (success | failure)

4.4 Interesting work (Optional !)
Book an appointment
i/p - doctor_id, patient_id, appointment_datetime
o/p - a message (booking successful or failed)


Day 3
Important Tip 
Are you getting SQLException while deleting a patien record ?
What is the reason ?
Simple Solution
- delete recs from the appointments table (child records)
Then try it again

OR
Replace hard delete by soft delete.

1. Hands on in combined lab
1.1 Create dynamic web project (day3_lab)
1.2 Create FirstServlet & deploy it with annotation
- It should be eagerly loaded.
1.3 Create Secondservlet & deploy it with xml tags
- It should be loaded lazily (i.e after client sends a request)

2. Refer to 
- "day3_data\day3_help\HTML pages\calc.html"calc.html

Write Calculator Servlet , to render the result of the specified operation.
- singleton & lazy.

3. Test Servlet & JDBC integration.
- Patient Login

4. Complete pending work.
- in the  individual labs.


Reading H.W
1. "day3_data\day3_help\informal sequence.txt"
2. "day3_data\day3_help\readmes\regarding HttpServlet.txt"



Day 3
1. Extract java docs
- "day4_data\jakartaee-javadoc.7z"
Open index.html in web browser.


2. For reference , pls keep 
"day4_data\day4_help\sequence.txt"


4. import day4.1 in your workspace
(import it exactly same as importing java projects)
Edit DB password from DBUtils.java

Revise entire flow
Start from index.html
-> login.html
-> PatientLoginServlet
-> PatientDashboardServlet
Important points
servlet-JDBC integration
Redirect
Cookie based session tracking

6. import day4.2 in your workspace
(import it exactly same as importing java projects)
Edit DB password from DBUtils.java

Open 
-> PatientLoginServlet
-> PatientDashboardServlet
Important points
Cookie based session tracking is replaced by HttPSession interface


7. Mandatory assignment - 
Simplest & easiest exercise to understand redirection & session tracking(cookie based)
Continue with the yesterday's CalculatorServlet.
You have already computed result of the operation yesterday right ?
Continue with it.
DO NOT display the result in CalculatorServlet.

If the result of operation is >= 0 , redirect the client to next page
- Result1Servlet
-display message - Result is >=0 print actual result value

Otherwise (result < 0) , redirect the client to next page 
- Result2Servlet & display message - Result is <0  print actual result value.

8. Optional assignment
- Render upcoming patient appointments from the patient dashboard.

Day 5
In combined lab
1. import day5.1 in your workspace.
(import it exactly same as importing java projects)
Edit DB password from DBUtils.java
1.1 - walk through entire code , to revise the flow.
1.2 Add Cancel Appointment functionality & test it.

2. Troubleshooting Tips

3.  import day5.2 in your workspace.
(import it exactly same as importing java projects)
Edit DB password from web.xml
Revise servlet config & replace it by servlet context (if time permits !)


4. In the individual labs - Mandatory work 
Add new link in index.html
Doctor Registration
-> doctor_reg.html
-> submit the form to DoctorRegServlet
->  DoctorRegServlet invokes DoctorDao ->
-> validate for unique email if not redirect the client to reg form again.
-> If valid (i.e no dup email) , inserts a record & redirect the client to doctor login form.


Day 6

Revise JDBC & Servlets

Day 7
1. import day7.1 in your workspace
- Revise basic JSP syntax
- Keep readme_jsp.txt (or pdf) or your notes open.
- Keep java docs open.

2. Refer 
- "day7_data\JSP basic assignment.png"
We will discuss & solve it together in combined Lab.

3. Mandatory work
- Go through complete flow of HealthCare , using 
day5_lab or your own solution , if you have created it.
Tomorrow , we are going to port the same case study with MVC pattern
- Servlet : controller
- JSP : view layer(UI)
- DAO , POJOs : data access layer & model.
YOu can optionally create JavaBean based service layer as well.



Day 8
In the combined lab

1. import day8_mvc in your workspace.
- Revise MVC pattern , implementation & flow.
- continue with the implementation.
separation of concerns 
- content generation(B.L) and presentation logic
Tech stack - Servlet(controller) , JDBC based DAO , JSP based view layer, Model - POJOs/ DTOs

- we will try to complete the case study from patient's perspective.



In the individual labs - 
Ensure that you have a stable net connection.
Mandatory work - 
Create <Template Projects> folder  in "web java study material folder "

Download & extract - template projects\hibernate_template.7z"

2. import existing Maven Project in your workspace.
2.1 File - import - Maven -Existing Maven Project - Browse -
template projects\hibernate_template
Finish

2.2 Force update the Maven , to download the dependencies. 
R click on the project - Maven - Update Project - select the check box 'Force Update'

This will create Maven local repository folder (under user home /.m2) - 1st time only .
It will download hibernate dependencies(hibernate JARs , mysql connector jar) and cache it under Maven local repo.
Then onwards you don't need a net connection (till spring !)


3. import day8.1 as dynamic web project ( File - import - General - Existin Project)
Revise 
- URL rewriting (added in JSP basic assignment)

4.  import day8.2 as dynamic web project ( File - import - General - Existin Project)
Revise 

- JSP Directives 
 - include
- JSP Actions
 - forward , include , param

Optional Extra help
"day8_data\day8_help\JSP Using Java beans.txt"


6. Optional weekend work (MVC implementation)
Create new dynamic web project
welcome page - /WEB-INF/pages/doctor_login.jsp
-> login form 
-> invalid -> forward doc to login form again
-> valid -> redirect to Doctor dash board
-> get required details -> forward to doc_dashbaord.jsp
-> render doctor name & speciality
-> List of his/her appointments (scheduled)
- it should display patient name , phone no , date/time
-> Add Complete/Done button.
After the consultation  is done , doc should be able to change appointment status from SCHEDULED -> COMPLETED

-> Add Cancel button.
Due to some reason , doc should be able to cancel  appointment status from SCHEDULED -> CANCELLED

3. Write a Tester to test.

4. Confirm auto table creation
- code first approach(i.e by writing Entity class) -> hibernate will create table. 
- create a package - com.healthcare.entities
Copy User.java & UserRole,.java , from "\day9_data\ready code"

5. Add mandatory annotations

6. Run the Tester again & confrim table creation.

7. Add optional(but recommended) annotations to customize 
 - table , columns & constraints

8. Drop table & run tester again

9. Create Hibernate based dao layer & testers
Objectives

- "day9_data\code\healthcare_mvc_front_controller"


Day 10
Highlight - CRUD in Hibernate , Entity State Transitions with Session API

1. import day10.1 , in your workspace as existing Maven Project
1.1 Edit DB password from hibernate.cfg.xml

1.2 To revise completely , Trace the code in top down manner
- Testers

1. UserRegistration.java - persist
2. DisplayUserDetailsById.java - find & L1 caching
3. DisplayAllUsers.java - JPQL & Query
4. DisplayUsersByRoleAndDate.java -  JPQL & Query & named IN params (:paramName)
5. DisplayUsersLastNamesByRole.java - single column projection
6. DisplaySelectedUserDetailsByRole.java - multiple cols projection - JPQL ctor expression.
7. ChangePassword.java - auto dirty checking (detached vs persistent)
8. ApplyBulkDiscount.java - JPQL : update
9. DeleteUserDetailsById.java - Entity - removed state.
